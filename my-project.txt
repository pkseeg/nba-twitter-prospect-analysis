Psych/Draft Model w/Colin from the Kings

Nice!

Notes:
3. Psych/Draft Model !!!!!!!!
  - NBA Twitter accounts
  - personality traits based on tweets
  - EXTREMELY interested
  - build it into a draft model

My ideas:
- +/- model for each player account (compared to baseline model)
- timeline of positivity/negativity
- show how much this affects play/prospectivity
