- Chat with Nate
  - don't feel like I need to do Nate's project further
  - get all his code somehow
  - collaborating with people who have already done work is a big skill in the data science community
More of a mentorship thing
  - couple zoom calls throughout the semester
  - emails once a week-ish

Project itself
  - who a person is and how they think matters to what they do
  - lots of teams have been turning to personality tests, psych data to get an edge
  - very okay if this project shows that there is nothing in there
  - Nate took it to correlate with on-court performance
  - if I throw in these pysch metrics into a draft model
  - prediction:
    - length of career
    - second contract
    - draft position
      - maybe people who can sell themselves better
  - data scraping, reporting visualization, etc
  - are they pushing products?
  - topics of the tweets themselves is super interesting
  - instagram API


- basketball schedule, basketball decisions
  - winning streak, losing streak, trade deadline, playoffs, etc
  - players with this type of personality during losing streak will turn to social media, etc
    - this guy will always be agreeable regardless of
  - guy around extension time, does it matter?

- player similarity is a tricky thing to sell and explain to people
- scouting meeting
  - 8 components
  - agreeableness is hurting
  - details are not as important!
  - "personality is a bump in the right direction"
  - holistically, comparison
